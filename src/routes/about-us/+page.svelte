				high school he had signed up with the Marines on one condition - that they train him to
				operate heavy machinery. Frank has over 25 years of experience with heavy equipment
				operation and has done everything on all sorts of large and small machines, from commercial
				work to road work, septic systems, housing developments â€“ you name it!
